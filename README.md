Tomato Warehouse Robot
====================

Autonomous robot capable of  following the line and bringing tomato tins to base.

The basic chassis (made from alloy plate that I designed for the particular purpose of tomato tin collection), carries four geared motors. The power supply consists of 2 LiPo battery packs (11.1 V, 2.2 Ah). 
The main program is executed in the Microcontroller C2000 Picollo (Texas Instruments). The input signals from light sensors are processed by the Picollo that consequently generates PWM outputs for the PWM motor controller.
