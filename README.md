The basic chassis, from alloy plate designed for special purpose (tomato tin collection), carries four geared motors. The power supply are 2 LiPo battery packs (11.1 V, 2.2 Ah).
The main program operates in the Microcontroller C2000 Picollo (Texas Instruments). The input signals from light sensors are processed in Picollo that consequently generates PWM outputs for PWM motor controller.
